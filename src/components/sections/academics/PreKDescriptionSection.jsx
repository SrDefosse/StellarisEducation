              At Stellaris, our Pre-K program provides a foundation for lifelong learning through a playful, inquiry-based approach. Our classrooms offer a nurturing environment where children develop socially, emotionally, and academically.

              Using the International Baccalaureate framework along with language immersion, our youngest learners begin their educational journey by exploring concepts through guided play, stimulating activities, and meaningful interactions with our international faculty.

              Children are natural inquirers, and our curriculum builds on their curiosity by encouraging questions, exploration, and discoveryâ€”establishing the skills they will use throughout their academic career.
